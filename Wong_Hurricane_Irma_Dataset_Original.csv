Understanding the Decision Making of Evacuees

 

Doctoral student Stephen Wong (with Professor Susan Shaheen and Professor Joan Walker), from the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley), is conducting a research project.  You are invited to participate in this study because of your experience in the recent evacuation process for the recent disaster. The researchers will be obtaining your consent for this project.

 

Why is this study being done?

Disasters have a major impact on the built environment and many situations require the movement of people away from harm to reduce risk and ensure human safety.  This evacuation of people is an integral part of emergency management plans.  Despite advances in transportation management strategies, evacuations continue to cause congested conditions on transportation networks.  At the same time, vulnerable populations frequently lack adequate resources for evacuation and sheltering, and a large proportion of the population do not comply with evacuation orders.  As part of this study, we are analyzing how individuals make decisions after receiving a mandatory or recommended evacuation order. 

 

What will happen if I take part in this research study?

We will ask you survey questions related to your experience with evacuating or not evacuating your residence during the last disaster.  These questions will include demographic information about you and your household, the address of your household, the choices you made during the event, and your opinions on the use of sharing economy platforms (i.e., technology platforms that allow the sharing of goods such as transportation and housing). If the survey includes questions you do not wish to or cannot answer, you may either choose to skip those questions, or you may choose not to participate in the study. All pieces of personal information and personal information of others will be kept as confidential as possible. Only one member from each immediate household may take the survey. You may fill out the survey at a time and place of your choosing.

 

How long will I be in the research study?

The survey will take approximately 20 minutes.

 

Are there any potential benefits if I participate?

Participants will not directly benefit from the research.  However, the results of the research may contribute to an improved understanding of individualsâ€™ decision making in disaster situations. 

 

Will I be compensated for my time?

A participant will be entered into a drawing if the participant 1) completes the survey, and 2) provides an email address or home address. These individuals will be eligible to win 1 of 5 VISA Gift Cards valued at $200 each. The drawing will take place when the last survey is received. For any drawing, the odds of winning depend on how many people have a ticket entered in the drawing. As we do not know how many people will participate in this study-related drawing, we cannot predict what will be the odds of winning a prize. Individuals who win will be sent the gift cards within two weeks of the drawing through email or through their physical home address.

 

Are there any other parts to this research?

You will have the opportunity to indicate if you are interested in being a part of a focus group. Only individuals who mark their interest in a focus group AND provide an email address, telephone number, or physical address will be eligible. When the surveys are completed, individuals will be chosen at random to participate in a focus group. If you are chosen, you will be contacted within 3 months from the end of the surveys.

 

Are there any potential risks or discomforts that I can expect from this study?

If you experienced stress or anxiety during the evacuation process, you may remember some of these feelings and you may find it uncomfortable to answer certain questions.  However, the questions are phrased to minimize any lasting negative effects. There is also a risk of a breach of confidentiality. This will risk has been minimized by using encrypted password-protected data storage and by omitting exact street addresses in any publications or reports on the research.

 

 



Will information about me and my participation be kept confidential?

Your information will be kept as confidential as possible.  Confidentiality will be maintained by using encrypted password-protected data storage on the web.  Only the primary researchers will have access to this data. Participants should close the webpage after they have finished the survey in order to protect their privacy. Confidentiality cannot be guaranteed since data will be transmitted online and data will be stored online.

 

How long will data be retained?

Data will be retained for at most three years after the last survey has been conducted.

 

What are my rights if I take part in this study?

Â·       You can choose whether or not you want to be in this study, and you may withdraw your consent and discontinue participation at any time.

Â·       Whatever decision you make, there will be no penalty to you or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.

Â·       You may refuse to answer any questions that you do not want to answer and still remain in the study.

 

Whom can I contact if I have questions about this study?

Their messages were clear and concise.  This was a big f'ing hurricane and it was heading right up the center of the state and the potential for catastrophic damage was huge.  That was very clear and made clear.  Their planning paid off.  

Highway Patrol did an impressive job of keeping the roads flowing.  I made it in 1.5 hrs for the evacuation.  FHP had two troopers and a tow truck on every single disabled vehicle I saw as I headed north.   They should be proud of how they did -- it was a phenomenal response. 

I wanted to evacuate on Wednesday/Thursday to beat the traffic, but according to Google Maps' traffic indications, many other people had the same idea.  So I waited an extra night, watching the traffic maps.  From past experience, people don't evacuate between 10pm-9am.  My hunches were confirmed by Google Maps.  So on Friday at 3am, I got in my car, swung by the office for one time, and headed north.   It was by-far the fastest I've ever made it from Fort Myers to St. Petersburg.  It normally takes 2.25 hours normally, >3+ hours with rush hour traffic.  

Interestingly, this was the storm path emergency managers had always feared.  To the point that it didn't get discussed often.  I worked in the media at one point in my life and asked what were the plans if a storm came right up the center of the state.  ""Pray it doesn't....You can't evacuate the entire state"" is what I was told.   Statistically, it was unlikely, so we generally didn't plan for this pathway.  

Really, the only issues I came across were shortages of bottled water and bread.  Why people gravitate towards these things in an emergency is beyond me.  Wine and non-perishable foods work just as well if not better.   There were sporadic fuel shortages, but if one station was out, there was usually another down the road which still had fuel.  Fuel deliveries were constant.

There needs to be better communication to those who live in flood prone areas well ahead of a storm. Do not have us rushing around buying supplies to ""hunker down"" in place only to be told one day ahead of the storm to ""get out."" 
This was the worst situation I have seen in Florida in 22 years. People running around like animals just to top off their tanks when people who really needed gas had to hope they could make the next station. It is bad enough that in SW Florida, you may have to drive for 20 miles before the next exit and hope there is even one gas station at that exit that has fuel.

Those who live more inland were not required to evacuate.  (I live approximately 4-5 miles inland, and was not required to evacuate.)  The recommended ""everyone evacuate"" order was truly impractical, because there would have been nowhere for all of us to go, and so much traffic if we all had actually left that we would have been at a standstill, and risked being in a more dangerous situation in a car when the storm actually hit.  Plus, I have pets that I would not leave behind.

It is difficult to express to those not living here the high degree of uncertainty that came with Hurricane Irma and its landfall location.  Up until the day before landfall, there was still question about which Florida coast would be the landfall point.  Also, regardless of which coast was hit, the storm was expected to travel up the entire state.  Florida's geography, being one long penninsula, makes it difficult to evacuate the state altogether.  It is an 8-hour drive north with zero traffic (with really only a couple of highways to choose from) in order to leave the state from southern Florida.  Traffic during an evacuation makes that trip substantially longer, with no gas or shelter locations along the way.  The size of Hurricane Irma, and the uncertainty of landfall location, ruled out East-West evacuation to the other coast.  

Many who live here work in the healthcare industry, as I do (I'm a nurse).  We were required to be at work in the hospital, or risk being fired.  Not everyone can just leave.  Even if we had all left, it would be almost impossible to get back after the storm in a timely manner, because everyone else would be doing the same thing.

At some point, people stopped listening until a few days before the storm.  With the shifting pattern of where the storm would go, there was a lot of uncertainty -- that played out as panic at the grocery stores and gasoline stations.  There was a lack of just bringing in gasoline trucks prior to the power going out.  If supply had been consistent, everyone could have gotten what they needed -- but as it worked out -- people were hoarding because of panic.
We didn't leave because one of us had to work during the storm as a local government employee --- and we were concerned after hearing horror stories from friends who left and could then not find hotels or gasoline on the trip.

I personally think in a country such as ours that it should be required that enough water be sent to a state where people are under a hurricane watch even if it has to come from other states that are not effected by it. Add this to the hype and over excitement caused by the TV news stations, people at stores were fist fighting, cussing and yelling at one another and just over all being hateful instead of trying to help one another. I believe that TV News is important and it seems to be the MOST utilized means of media, that they have a responsibility to not OVERREACT and get people over emotional. I realize as people they are probably scared too for the same reasons but again, if that is their job, they need to report responsibly.

The very next Service Plaza (and every one thereafter) had long lines and signs directing you to go to the next Plaza. The next place we stopped was on 1-10.

A Sheriff's car was sitting at the exit to the plaza, so we asked him if there was gas on the south side of the highway. He said he didn't know in a fairly rude tone of voice, which surprised us. We did find one (of four) gas stations on the south side of the exit did have gas available, so were able to fill up.
We did ask an out-of-state relative to help us out by using Gas Buddy, but it really didn't help too much. Mostly we were able to find gas just by pulling off at different exits when we had about 1/4 tank full.

We stayed in our house because the wind speed was projected to be a category 2 when it hit.  Didn't know about the continuous tornado warnings we would endure, the sound of the wind hitting out house, and the stress associated with it.  

We stayed in our house even though we lost power at 10:30 AM and at 9 Pm we discovered water was coming in all our doors.  Our garage flooded and water was still rising and coming in the house.  We called the police for help and advice and the operator said they weren't going out on calls.  I called a friend and they came to rescue us from the flooding in a 4x4 truck. We escaped our house through thigh high water with 4 ziplock bags of belongings and a cooler of food for my son with allergies.

I traveled alone in my Honda Civic and left quite early wanted to get ahead of major traffic. I am single and live alone so I was the only one that needed to evacuate specifically from my house.   I live just feet away from evacuation zone A on the Indian River Lagoon. I stayed for hurricane Matthew, but Irma seem to be a much more dangerous storm. My dad let me know a few days before the storm hit that he was planning to go to Atlanta to my uncle?s house, but he could not leave until Friday morning around 10 AM. I thought that was too long to wait and I was right. I left at 2 AM on Friday and it took 14 hours to get to Atlanta, and it took my father almost 18 hours For the same trip. The trip up wasn?t Terrible, but it was very tiring traveling with a chronic illness for 14 hours on the road alone. I was dehydrated and stressed out from the traffic.

The ride back on Tuesday was a different story. First, I downloaded the gas buddy app to be sure that I had a resource to find fuel if needed. I made the plan to keep my fuel tank at 3/4 full at all times because of the Traffic. On my way home on interstate 75, I stopped at a gas station in Adel, GA Where a woman came up to me at the gas pumps. She said her husband pulled up to a pump that was out of order and she felt that I needed to give up my pump because they were there first. She was extremely confrontational and I was frightened as I was traveling alone. People were staring because the woman was yelling at me and I didn?t know what to do. Finally, I told her that it was my pump, I was traveling alone as a woman with a chronic illness, and I needed to get fuel and get back on the road. It was a very troubling experience. I don?t think I will ever forget her face. She came at me with such anger. I still can?t understand why anyone would do that, especially to a woman traveling alone.  

The trip back to Florida only took 12 hours in comparison to the 14 hour trip...This was surprising as on my way back into North Florida, Siri routed me onto side roads And I ended up at the back road that had portions flooded. I felt that in my car it was not safe to proceed, but I couldn?t figure out how to get my phone to reroute back to I 75 so I had to use my memory to backtrack to the main highway.

 Again, it was a stressful situation and during future Evacuations I will be cognizant of the fact that Siri is not up to date on where roads are flooded, especially side roads. I also will not travel alone because I really needed someone there to talk to during the long stops in traffic and for safety.  I also plan to get a larger vehicle to where I could transport fuel cans and not have to worry about being stranded without fuel. Or...I could just move out of Florida and no longer have to worry about evacuations.

By traveling the evacuation route out of Florida via interstate 75, I?m perplexed as to why there are not more lanes in Georgia, and why the shoulders of the interstate leading out of Florida are not more readily accessible to vehicles. There should also be more digital billboards giving traffic updates as it is dangerous to constantly check your phone while you?re driving.  There were also some inaccuracies on the delays via my phone?s GPS that would cause unnecessary braking/slowing by others as they expected traffic ahead too.

Our original plan was to go to Orlando.  Disney said they would not let us keep the dogs in our room and they would have to stay at the kennel,  which we could not afford.    We assumed all of the hotels would have a similar policy, plus most hotels were sold out. 
Also,  we were on the verge of panicking.    Later we found out that all hotels in Florida had to take dogs because of a FEMA rule.   We didn't know about the rule.   We found out after traveling to Pennsylvania.  We went to Pennsylvania because we found out that we could keep the dogs with us at LaQuinta Inns.  The only one we found that we could stay 3-4 days was in PA.  The rest of the LaQuintas were sold out in Tennessee,  Georgia,  Alabama,  and south Carolina.   Also,  a Comfort Inn said we could keep the dogs if we stayed with them,  but we would have to pay $60 per dog per night.  The next hurricane we will probably not evacuate and tough it out.

",Very effective,Slightly effective,Moderately effective,Extremely effective,Very effective,"     On your survey I answered a question wrong, but it wouldn't go back. We were ordered to stay inside (no emt's would be available). Residences very near us were ordered to evacuate.
     We have 7 children. One is an epileptic, medically fragile, insulin dependant diabetic. When we made plans to evacuate, Irma's forecasted eye path was directly over our home. Though block & sturdy, it is only about 2 miles inland from the Atlantic. We boarded the windows and put sandbags at the doors. The odds of losing power were pretty much 100%, and our kid needs electricity to survive.
     Then, we packed our family pictures, 3 koolers, 10 bags of clothes, (one for each) medicines, insulin, a wheelchair, a toddler potty, the tent, our gun, a bag of balls and gloves for pit stops, each kids favorite thing (from saxaphones to ceramic banks), 5 backpacks full of homeschool textbooks, my camera, 3 tablets, and a partridge in a pear tree. Just kidding, but our van was utterly ridiculous. 
     The major highways were gridlocked & many places out of gas, so we drove on back roads as much as possible, picking up I-10 west of Tallahassee. I used google maps constantly to evaluate our path and we detoured at least 3 times when it was red ahead. We waited in line for an hour to get gas in a tiny town 11 miles off of our route, but it was the only place stocked. The drive that normally would take 8 hours took 22. However, we were moving at 30 mph or greater the entire time. (Except for bathroom breaks and gas lines)
      There was a shared sense of community during the evacuation. People were kinder than usual. I waited in line for a potty break with some Japanese tourists that had been honeymooning at Disney. They were terrified and had no idea where they were going besides away from Irma. 
     Overall, we would do it again and take the same back roads route, using Google maps to assist. (We only had one tiny flub up where it tried to send us down a resident's driveway in backwoods. Nope. U turn.)  22 hours in a car with 7 anxious kids was torturous, but the peace of knowing we were safe when tornados were passing through our neighborhood was worth every minute travelling and every dollar spent.

We are not at risk for flooding/storm surge, and we do not take the brunt on the wind.  We live in a relatively new concrete block home built to stringent codes that take hurricanes into account.  If a category 4 or 5 was going to hit us directly, we would consider evacuating. Otherwise, our family evacuating is only taking a hotel room inland from another family who lives beachside or is under mandatory evacuation.  Also, the unpredictability of hurricanes is a factor.

Florida has been impressive in communication and care and safety of its citizens. I'm not a fan of Florida Governor Rick Scott but during the evacuation of Florida due to Irma, he knocked it out of the park. He did a phenomenal job of getting on television early and often, communicated clearly and made it clear this was serious. Roads were a breeze for us to evacuate... tolls suspended. I felt reassured and we were taken care of. We knew what was going on every step of the way. It was incredible how it was handled. 
California wildfires... newscasts we're a disaster. Nobody knew what was going on. Aan entire mountain community in San Diego -Crest- literally burned to the ground whilke the news was busy reporting on an affluent neighborhood in the fire zone. Government agencies inept there during crisis. During wildfires we felt completely all alone, lkeft to fend for ourselves.

The fear and stress of evacuating outweighs the work involved in sheltering in place. I have permanent shutters that I close and would feel quite safe inside. The only reason why I went inland to my son's house was because I'd just gotten an RV which I was afraid would be damaged, and a friend kept telling me that the storm surge would be bad. As it turned out, Irma came in on the west side of the state, and I live on the east side, so although there was a lot of damage, I could have stayed home, but for worry about the RV. 
In the end result, the worst inconvenience was the loss of power and water after the storm. For these things, the RV turned out to be a lifesaver.

It took us more than 12 hours in traffic-- and honestly that was probably making GOOD time! During Irma, as soon as evacuation looked like a possibility (about a week out), I made hotel reservations inland in Orlando. I reviewed my hotel options and picked a location I felt was on reasonably high ground (let's face it-- it's Florida-- it's all pretty flat), in area with new construction and several hospitals where there would be good services and emergency response. As it turns out, the area we picked has underground power lines-- and the hotel had a parking garage. We will be VERY likely to evacuate there again. We were concerned about whether we were going ""far enough"", but with the uncertainty in the storm's path and practically the whole state evacuating, we didn't want to risk being on the road longer than necessary. Running out of gas in the path of the storm is the worst POSSIBLE outcome. So we went an hour inland, to a place we felt would be reasonably safe except in the event of a direct hit, and hoped for the best. I work for the military and my place of employment is also on the barrier island. So the base was evacuated too. My husband's employer is on the mainland, but also closed in advance of the storm. 
I felt like there were a lot of great resources and information available-- the county's emergency management on Facebook, their automatic text/twitter notifications, the my employer (the military's) automatic text/twitter notifications, local emergency services feeds, the local TV stations weather and meteorology personnel, and even some of the local ""community"" pages on facebook.

The fact that extra port-o-potties, had been put out at every rest area was very convenient. I only wish they had left them out a little longer for the return trip. I evacuated alone with 2 small dogs. So, the port-o-potties made it easier for me to use the restroom. On my return trip home, I didn't stop as much. The very first time I did stop to use the restroom on my way home, I returned to see someone about to break my window of my car, because my dogs started barking as soon as I got out of my car. With the port-o-potties, I was able to walk my dogs on the way to the line. And, was able to take my dogs in the potty with me. Most rest areas, do not allow dogs around the main building. So, when I had to use the restroom, my dogs had to stay in the car. If they could have port-o-potties available during evacuations and for returning evacuees, that would be so helpful. 
Another suggestion I have is, if southern states could add ""service areas"", like they have up north. That way, instead of having to exit into a town, you can just go to an area that is more like a rest area. Only, instead of a simple rest area, there are places to get food, use the restroom and, get gas.

It was horrible. Spent thousands of dollars and got stuck in traffic on the 528.  People don?t realize that there?s only one way out of Florida and the evacuation process is treacherous. We returned to Cocoa Beach to 10 days without power. 

We evacuated for Matthew, and again, it was very expensive. We took care of my elderly parents who could not afford to evacuate. The stress and the news coverage beforehand was almost unbearable. Our home received minor damage. We were lucky. 

We decided not to evacuate for Irma mainly because of the uncertainty of her path. We live on the east coast and the storm kept veering west. It didn?t make sense to go closer to the storm and head right into the belly of the beast.  The size of Irma was overwhelming. We felt that we couldn?t escape her no matter where we went in Florida, so we decided to stay. We live oceanfront and it was the worst night of my life.

Knowing how bad traffic would be we left days earlier - North FL hotels only had one night vacancy bc they were already booked up from others making their way up north so we stayed one night after a 7-8hr drive in N FL and the next day headed to GA, not knowing where we were going. Macon was completely booked so between my husband and I (who were each in our own car in fear of leaving a car behind and being totaled from potential flooding) we sat in the parking lot at the Ramada who had no vacancy despite Hotels.com saying they did, we called every place possible and finally found a second rate hotel with enough vacancy in Forsyth, GA. It was a horrible place to stay, but the people of the town were amazing and incredibly friendly. Glued by the tv, we saw our mayor being interviewed and all the evacuation districts. Media did sensationalize quite a bit- we did notice that. When I got a text from a friend who rode out the storm and said it's safe to come back, we did- this was the day after the hurricane hit. What we weren't prepared in was coming back to a state with no food open, no power, no gas and knowing we would be running out. No vacancies anywhere. A friend in Palo Alto figured out my gas % and said I had enough to get to Tampa. After one last final attempt using Gasbuddy, a Speedway was open and we got right in and we're able to fill up and make it back to Fort Myers. We got back to a complete black out, no lights, very dark and disorienting and nothing but massive trees, traffic lights, signs and some structural bldgs down. We had no damage to our property other than lost trees. No power for five days and it was awful, no wind, no a/c, utter heat and humidity. I flew back to Texas the day the airport opened back up (Thursday) and saw Air Force One land (people were so pissed Trump was here, delaying our flights and not really doing anything). I spent another five days with family in San Antonio and Austin (my father died and handling his estate on top of having to give a talk at a conference- also learned catastrophic news the day I evacuated at my work so the whole summer was a mindf$&@ and I found it fitting to end it all with a massive hurricane approaching). My husband stayed with a friend whose power came back on. My research center (clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease) was out of commission and having no power, we lost all of our antibody drugs that required refrigeration (no, this was not the catastrophic news as it was prior). It could have been much worse, so as a first timer going through a hurricane, we learned what we did right and what we need to improve on. Gulf Shore Life did an interview on me. Short but too the point. Forsyth and Macon were a complete eye opener.

Additionally, my sister helped an elderly neighbor evacuate. I made the reservations early (days in advance) for myself & rest of family members as I watched the news & weather reports. I made all the reservations in a place that I knew we were able to cancel without fees, and used prior evacuation experiences to inform my decisions. Having said that, I am glad that we were evacuated because our area was without power & water, some family members for more than a week! Plus the weather ended up much worse at home than anticipated with very severe bands causing tornados and more. At our location inland, we never lost power or water during the evacuation, and we actually ended up closer to the eye of the storm than if we had stayed at home.

I live a mile or 2 from US 1. Now, I'm not meteorologist, buuuuut, when a 400 mile wide Cat 4/5 hurricane is bearing down on the region, and witnessing what it did to the neighboring Island Nations in the Caribbean, I don't think a hurricane adheres to evacuation zones. I decided to pack and protect my place and shut it down and leave to my friend's apartment in West Palm Beach, an hour north from my place and also 15 miles west and more inland. Even when I went to his place, he and his family were planning to drive out west to the gulf coast to get to better shelter. At that time, I was watching all the reports on the news and staying in contact with my work. I remember Thursday Sep 7 seeing reports on the national news outlets stating to ""Evacuate Immediately"" and ""we can't help you in the middle of the storm"" and watching the destruction in the Caribbean, I decided I was not going to stay for the storm when it was that close and had no idea what it was going to do when it got here. I was mainly concerned for my well being and ultimately the worst case scenario of being stranded on my own after the damage. I was lucky enough to be able to get a flight out the next day to be with family up North and ride it out. The timing and preparation of evacuating several million people could have been more efficient with more time as it approached. I think the Governor was clear to everyone that he wanted us all to leave or be safe no matter what. The problem came between deciding between mandatory and voluntary, but as I stated before, a 400 mile wide cat4/5 hurricane doesn't care. I think the headache and discomfort of evacuating millions is far better than risking staying and facing destruction. Nobody should be punished for making a decision to protect themselves and their families, the Governor could have communicated that better to employers throughout the state.

Government is not flexible and is too rigid and restrictive with how it treats its citizens. Not enough leeway to work with the government. All I expect from them is to work with the meteorologists to make a distinct decision on who is at most risk & needs to evacuate and best possible ways to get out and where to go. Announcements on the TV & radio work to a degree, but there should already be a plan in place to communicate to people what best to do.

My mother , sister, and I were in Cuba visiting my ill grandparents who have cancer. My father put up shutters on wednesday evening at their house in naples,FL. Later that evening or early thursday the buzz starts going around abut our neighborhood being an evacuation zone and dad had to leave. At first he was a little hesitent because we have 2 little dogs who are our babies and we didnt know who would take him in with the 2 pups. He was thinking of a shelter but had no idea where the shelter for people with dogs were. I end up calling my husband frm cuba to tell him he has to take da in with the pups or go from port charlotte to naples to pick up the dogs. Finally my husband ends up convincing my dad to leave to out home in port charlotte. So he packs up early friday morning I believe around 6 or 7am he was scared stored would hit the area while being on the road so he wanted to leave early to port charlotte. Days prior to leaving naples, their was already no food or water at Walmart. He ended up going at 3am to get gas for the van and waited a mile on the road to finally get there and they ran out of gas. Streets for backed for miles waiting to get in line. And lets not even mention how nasty humans get under pressure we saw many gas station fights over gas. He also stopped to pick my grandparents but hes stubborn as a mule he decided he was gonna stay in naples so dad left them a generator and said good luck.  Once he actually makes it to port charlotte he unpacks his items and the dogs my mother in law already had a room waiting for him. She did a really great job. They decide to go and buy as much food and item as they can find since there were going to be a lot of people and dogs staying in the same place. They also put up boards and shutters on the houses that day. On one of the trips to gather items on the radio they start announcing mandatory evacuation for charlotte county as well as collier county. They decided to go back home and gather with the family to make a decision by the time they make it home. The police was already there. they only had 20mins to pack up everyone and everything including 6 dogs and 2 handycaps. They got whatever they could at the moment and put it in the cars. they also had to stop and pick up family on the road and an elderly neighbor they decided to help and take her to the shelter. Once they finally made it to i75 it took they 14hours to make it to douglass,GA. It was a horrifying seen with 6 dogs stuck on i75 waiting on traffic and an elderly on a wheelchair that has special accommodations. IT was hard bacuse there was no gas so they had to go masive lines. If they found gas for the vans they had to keep looking because not all gas stations had diesel for my husbands truck. No restaurants open not even  mcds so eating on the road was very hard. and the traffic was horrible. When they finally made it we were so relieved to hear that they had finally made it to a safe area. WE were constantly calling until at one point where the signal died and there was no connections from cuba to fl or from ga to fl. We were paying that my grandparentss were okay they were disappeared for 3 days we didnt hear anything from them. Finally they found someone kind enough and that had signal and let them bother the phone to call us in cuba and let us knoe they were okay because they were also unable to communicate with my dad or my husband. it was a horrifying experience but from this we have learned we have to get much better at preparing and never let an elderly decide for themselves what they want to do their stubborn and end up making things worse then what they should be. in tims of emergency you put them in the car and let them complain.but at least you have a peaceful state of mind. in total we were out of power for 12days and we lost all of our roof but thanks to Jehovahs god we are all safe and back at home.",18 - 24,Female,,"Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander,White",,Hispanic or Latino or Spanish Origin,High school graduate,Employed part time,2,1,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,,"Drive alone using a car, SUV, pickup, or van",,Prefer not to answer,florida,charlotte,port charlotte,No,,1 to 2 years,1 to 2 years,6,Site build (apartment),Yes,Yes,More than 5,,1,,,,,,,,,2,Prefer not to answer,I share equally in making decisions with another household member(s)

We recalled Hurricane Wilma which caused considerable roof damage to our house and that was just a low category 2 hurricane.  When the hurricane models predicted a more westerly track for Irma, we decided the family would shelter in place.  As it turned out we had virtually no damage (a few screens in the pool enclosure were damaged).  

Broward county's plans call for evacuation from the barrier islands to protect residents from storm surge.  During the initial track predictions, it appeared we would have significant storm surge and a mandatory evacuation was ordered for all residents east of Interstate 1 (Federal Highway), mobile homes, and residents living in areas know to be prone to flooding.

My boyfriend lives on a barrier island and was a mandatory evacuation, he has two cats. I lived at home at the time where my family had three large dogs. We made the choice, since he couldn't have his cats at my house and had to evacuate to leave together. We chose to go back to the panhandle because it appeared to be the only portion of the state that MAY not be hit by the hurricane. At the time we left Irma was headed straight for our home on the East coast of Florida as a Cat 5 and we did not want to take any chances. One day after we arrived in San Destin the hurricane had shifted towards us on the West coast of the state now. It's a terrible situation to be put in because you fret over leaving, worrying if you're making the right choice and knowing you're about to spend thousands of dollars that will be un-reimbursed and then you wake up and the hurricane has followed you and you realize you made the wrong decision and you should have stayed. But in the moment you made the decision it was the right one. You're forced to choose to leave or stay so far in advance of the storm actually arriving that it becomes a coin toss.

The fact that Florida has two major highways in and out is a huge problem when it comes to evacuating. It's nothing but a traffic jam and cars running on empty with no gas in sight. This, coupled with the fact that my mother is disabled and I have a back injury and cannot sit for long periods of time (or sleep just anywhere) were part of our decision. We had family to go to in Orlando but the storm turned and was headed there. Typically our area of the state has never had a direct hit (in 120 years of Hurricane Tracking) so we felt confident that we would get a storm that would be no greater than a Cat 2. Although we did receive wind and rain damage it wad nothing like other parts off the state and we actually slept through the brunt of the storm. We chose not to evacuate the year prior, when governor Scott told us that ""we would all DIE"" (yes. He actually said that on the news) if we did not evacuate for Matthew. Matthew wss definitely a stronger, more direct hit than Irma. With greater tree loss. However... We were fine then too. I feel there needs to be a fine balance between public safety and public panic which we saw a great deal of during Irma. Much of that I believe was a factor because of Harvey having just occurred in Houston. Anyway.. If you research it, you'll find that most residents did not evacuate here on the Island we live in (barrier island.. Merritt Island)...on my street alone only one house did. (To Orlando where they got hit worse)
I also had friends drive to Tampa and then end up returning here when the eye of Irma turned.

I left with the two young children and strong request of my father who lives in New England. He sent money for the hotel and gas otherwise I would not have been able to go. Hotels were booked all the way through Georgia and I finally decided on the 800 mile trip. Getting there was a long drive. Hundreds of accidents and many hours added on due to reroutings, which were beautiful by the way! Residents in the back roads stood outside and offered free food and drink in places and one church was offering lodging and food for the displaced on the road.
The hotel was great (Hampton Inn)! A local church brought in 50 pizzas, snacks, and drinks the first night there. We shouldn't have left three days later, but we're out of money and thought things would be fine when we returned.
The ride home took 26 hours. Accidents cluttered the highest every few miles. I found one hotel with a room open only to find it to be the equivalent of a sex trafficking hotel. I left with the children after being told my money wouldn't be refunded for days, leaving me with no sleep, on dark roads, hungry and weary.
Not one of the hundreds of churches we passed were offering assistance. Not ONE. I stopped at two serious rest stops to grab a couple hours of sleep at a time, sitting up... Car running...doors locked. I refilled my gas tank where I could but most places were out of gas, food, coffee, and even toilet paper. One place had septic backed up into the store and they just kept raking it out the front door. One rest stop had porta potties did into a hill with a water reservoir right below. By sunrise the second morning, my son was vomiting from eating nothing but crap snacks that we could find.
We finally made it home to no water and no power. It was 100 degrees. We spent much time in the car, running the A/C and driving around looking for food, water, and milk. Nothing was to be found. When the water came on a few days later, it was still undrinkable. We took cold showers because we are all electric. My oldest son, who is autistic, stated to become withdrawn. I heard about FEMA hotel rooms and applied. I was approved and immediately went to the hotel. We were in and out, and back and forth for days... Maybe a week. The kids school reopened. My five year old daughter started having anxiety attack for the first time in her life. 
The power company was so negligent and difficult, I have joined class action law suit. It took TEN DAYS for our power to be restored. Our nephew in the country waited 26 days.
Our rental home is newer and made of steel and block and made it through the storm undamaged. We had none of the expected flooding. 
The hurricane was dealable.
The power, water, food, and emergency management was horrendous. Awful. Horrible.

I made hotel reservations (Valdosta Ga) 5 days out from landfall from experience.  Initally we decided to evacuate due to the possibility of losing powrr, contaminated water, and wind damage. Life and comfort are more important than replaceable items. We evacuated to my parents in St. Marys Ga to evacuate with them to Valdosta, when tge hurricane changed course and was predicted to go over Valdosta we stayed put.  Regardless, we had high winds and rains since we were in the eastern quadrant of the storm. We lost power for 5 days before we decided to go home. The waterfront area of my parents town was destroyed, without a direct hit. Once we arrived home to Melbourne Do, we survayed the damage, which was minimal. We had power but no air conditioning. Every single grocery store was empty, everything gone. So we tried to find something open, we got lucky. We used the Waze App to find gas and avoid traffic, which we did. We pre plan before the hurricane season ends.

We exited the higheay and got stuck due to cars blocking interstate access in lines to get gas. It took four hours to drive 1 mile!! We were afraid for our lives and safety on the roads - drivers went northbound in open southbound lanes with cars traveling them!! Drivers went at high spoeds on road shoulders and there was a lot of panicked and aggressive driving along FL routes. We saw people broken down or out of gas who just had to abandon cars. We saw scores of vehicles left running on highway shoulders overnight while occupants tried to sleep. And we were aware that they were panicked and TIRED drivers out there - scary. Also, we had to drive for about 24 hours without a hotel stop because the evacuations were so far north. (Highway exit ramps were actually closed wth barriers and cars were forced to go on.)

I had to ask my friends and family, and consult with the desktop version of the map to see if I was in the part of the zone receiving the mandatory evacuation. I was. I checked FIU?s storm surge map under category 5 storm surge conditions, as that is what we were anticipating. Upon seeing that my neighborhood would be under 6-12 feet of water, I evacuated to Zone of E of Miami-Dade County, which was not under a mandatory evacuation. It was complicated to determine whether I would be safe if I evacuated to a different part of Miami.

I refilled at 2 am because that is when the gas stations were refilled. I would be hesitant to have a stranger in my car and drive for a long distance because I wouldn?t want to be responsible if another person pulled a gun on us. I also didn?t want to evacuate out of County because of this experience. If there was a gas shortage in Miami, I?m sure I would have faced similar circumstances around the state.

It?s not fair the Red Cross got all that money to do a job they didnt do; teachers are underpaid and overworked as it is. 
There were no assigned shelters. Shelters were filling up fast and I didn?t want to waste space when I had friends and family who weren?t in the evacuation zone who had offered to host me and my partner. Furthermore, knowing what I know about public schools- they are not well maintained and full of mold. I don?t feel safe enough in schools to seek it as a shelter.
There was little coordination for transit to get to the shelter. And driving during the lead up to the storm was chaotic and since I was nearly assaulted trying to fill up my gas tank, I did not want to be on the roads for very long.

We had to drive through the remains of Irma when it was a tropical storm Monday morning in Alabama and Georgia, in order to get back for my husband's job.  Because of the storm there were no gas stations the whole day, even using the GasBuddy app --the info wasn't accurate, there was no gas anywhere.  We made it to Gainesville Monday around 5 p.m. and were forced to stop for the night because we were almost out of gas. Finding a hotel was hard, nothing was available on Orbitz but we did find one calling around town.  Finding a place to get a hot meal was difficult but we figured that out too just before the curfew went into effect.  The next morning my husband drove around Gainesville looking for gas while I watched the kids at the hotel.  I called around and found a single station that had gotten a shipment earlier--he waited 2 hours to fill up.  After he picked us up at the hotel we didn't stop at all, there were gas stations on the turnpike but we wanted to make it back on one tank because there was at least 2-3 hours wait on those lines, we didn't even stop for the restroom to conserve gas and also because the lines in the rest areas along the turnpike spanned for a few miles before the exits.  I had food and water for the family so we just hunkered in and drove, I believe it took 6 hours from Gainesville. We
 returned on Tuesday and the entire day residents hadn't been allowed into our city (sunny isles beach) but thankfully it had opened back up.  I guess they had shut down some of the shelters at 5 a.m and told people to go home, and then they couldn't get back in to sunny isles because the city had shut it down--it didn't reopen until Tuesday afternoon. People were sleeping in their cars and hotels were booked up from workers being in town for the aftermath and evacuees.  I think the port reopened to deliver gas that evening or the next day, but if we had waited for that it would've been too late--my husband had to be at work Wednesday and would have lost his job.  And after the evacuation that would have been financially devastating.   It was exhausting and expensive.  

When we got home Tuesday night our power was on and we hadn't lost power the whole storm.  However FPL was doing repairs and cut our power in these repairs on Saturday 9/17. Rather than fix it immediately they put us in the back of the line for repairs. We were without power from Saturday-Wednesday afternoon, with my husband having work and one of my kids having to be at school.  I had to drive around those days finding air conditioning taking care of my younger son and also checking to see if our power was back on. We lost all the food in our fridge and freezer. It was hard to find hotels and we would be in a different hotel every night, checking out in the morning hoping that would be the day the power would come back on. We tried sleeping at our condo one night and it was unbearable, and I was worried about the kids the whole time.  Again neighbors with less financial means were sleeping in their cars, families with children--one of my elderly neighbors had to go to the hospital for heat exhaustion--the heat index topped 100 every day during that time.  

So to sum up I felt like the whole thing was ok as far as getting people out and to safety was concerned, but the aftermath was a complete failure on all fronts.  We took a big financial hit and didnt qualify for help from FEMA.  We experienced a lot of hardship, which pales in comparison to what others in my city experienced as a result of the evacuation and aftermath of Irma.  Also the storm didn't directly hit us, it damaged some signs and took out a lot of trees and some power to some buildings.  I can't imagine what would have happened if it hit us directly.  I feel completely unprepared for next hurricane season and that there's nothing I can do to prepare for a situation like this again.
