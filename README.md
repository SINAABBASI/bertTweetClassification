# DisasterTweetsClassification

Twitter is one of the most popular social media these days, and the best place to get breaking news instantly. Monitoring Twitter is interesting for a lot of companies, e.g. disaster relief organizations. In this regard, we are going to build a model for the disaster tweets classification task of whether the tweets are pointing to a real disaster or not. To overcome this problem, we proposed a model using contextualized BERT embedding layer. Our proposed model shows performance improvement in comparison to the base model with LSTM structure in terms of F1 score.

## Notebook
The only consideration for running notebook is that you have to run it (main.ipynb) with GPU.
